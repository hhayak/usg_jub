# USG JUB

USG JUB is a web app made for the Undergraduate Student Government in Jacobs University Bremen, using Flutter and Firebase. It is a platform that hosts elections organised by the USG. Only eligible students can vote. This is controlled by their academic major.

In the long term, I am aiming to add more tools to the web app besides hosting elections (eg. clubs directory, event funding application).
